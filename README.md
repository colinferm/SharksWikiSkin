# Stats For Sharks Skin

Not sure how useful this skin is going to be to the average MediaWiki developer. But, maybe it will be, who the hell knows...

Aside from the fact that the Template strips out a lot of the coded bullshit from the included MediaWiki templates, the main takeaway should be that MediaWiki can fit into pretty much any design, especially once said bullshit has been stripped.

Also, if one were to explore the Skin file, one might see that, based on categories and title data, a fair amount of per-page customization can actually be done.

As [Stats For Sharks](https://www.statsforsharks.com) has a fairly limited subject matter and data set, a fair amount has been hard coded and this probably shouldn't be the way a more general interest wiki handles things but, as Wikipedia pretty much has the "general interest" wiki area covered, I'm guessing most people setting up wikis are probably doing is for specific areas of interest and this might be useful.

The absolute, most important thing, is that _nothing_ has to be done the way the standard skins installed with MediaWiki has done things. In fact, those skins are so overly complicated, it's almost as if they were built to try to scare people away from doing their own or trying a look & feel _other_ than the MediaWiki/Wikipedia way of displaying things.

So... if for no other reason, that's why this is posted for public consumption.
